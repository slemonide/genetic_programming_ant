# genetic_programming_ant
Genetic programming algorithm for automating ant motion

# How it works

Ant is represented as a determinate finite automata with actions on transitions.
In the beginning, a population of ants is generated randomly. Then, ant is executed and amount of food eaten is calculated.
Ants that eat the most food proceed to the next round. They also have children which are generated by randomly combining two randomly
chosen parents from the previous generation. The number of ants each generation is thus kept the same.

Sometimes, there also could be a mutation which randomly modifies the ant's automata.
